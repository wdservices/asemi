# Manual Enrollment for Gospel

The user "Gospel" (ID: `uXvdtusVltrpiehZI84a`) made a payment for the "Learn AI" course (ID: `qp7aX8AICbo4ZV1kOPO5`) before the automated enrollment system was implemented.

## Solution

I've fixed the core issue where modules and lessons didn't have IDs in Firestore. The system now automatically generates IDs for backward compatibility.

## To Enroll Gospel Manually:

### Option 1: Use Firestore Console (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/asemi-c7777/firestore
2. Navigate to the `users` collection
3. Find the document with ID: `uXvdtusVltrpiehZI84a`
4. Add or update the `enrolledCourses` field:
   - If it doesn't exist, create an array field called `enrolledCourses`
   - Add the value: `qp7aX8AICbo4ZV1kOPO5`
   - If it already exists, add this course ID to the array

### Option 2: Use the Admin Panel
1. Add `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here` to your `.env.local` file
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/manual-enroll
3. Fill in:
   - User ID: `uXvdtusVltrpiehZI84a`
   - Course ID: `qp7aX8AICbo4ZV1kOPO5`
   - Admin Secret Key: (the key you set in .env.local)
4. Click "Enroll User"

## What Was Fixed:

1. **Module/Lesson ID Issue**: Courses in Firestore had modules and lessons as arrays without IDs. The code now automatically generates IDs like `module-0`, `lesson-0-0`, etc.

2. **Payment Verification**: Added a complete payment tracking system that stores all payments in a `payments` collection.

3. **Enrollment Verification**: The learn page now checks Firestore directly if the local state shows the user is not enrolled.

## After Enrollment:

Gospel should be able to:
1. See "Go to Course" button on the course page
2. Access all course videos and lessons
3. Navigate between modules and lessons

The "Redirecting to first module..." error will be resolved.
