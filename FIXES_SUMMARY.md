## Previous Fixes (From Earlier Session)

### 4. ✅ Course Enrollment Issue Fixed
**Problem:** User "Gospel" paid for course but got "Redirecting to first module..." error

**Root Cause:** 
- Modules and lessons in Firestore didn't have `id` fields
- Code expected `module.id` and `lesson.id` which didn't exist

**Solution:**
- Updated all course fetch functions to auto-generate IDs for backward compatibility
- Modules get IDs like: `module-0`, `module-1`
- Lessons get IDs like: `lesson-0-0`, `lesson-0-1`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/mockData.ts` - Updated `getAllCourses()`, `getCourseById()`, `getCourseBySlug()`

---

### 5. ✅ Payment Tracking System Implemented
**Problem:** No payment records were being stored

**Solution:** Created complete payment tracking system

**Features:**
- All payments stored in Firestore `payments` collection
- Payment verification before granting course access
- Payment status tracking (success, failed, pending)
- Manual enrollment tools for admin

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/lib/mockData.ts` - Added payment functions
- `src/app/api/verify-payment/route.ts` - Enhanced with payment storage
- `src/app/api/manual-enroll/route.ts` - Manual enrollment endpoint
- `src/app/admin/manual-enroll/page.tsx` - Admin enrollment page
